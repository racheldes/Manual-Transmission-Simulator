# Manual-Transmission-Simulator

This project simulates the behavior of a manual transmission vehicle, where the driver must actively change gears based on the vehicle’s speed. In vehicles with manual transmissions, drivers need to adjust gears to control how engine rotation impacts axle rotation. Lower gears allow for slower speed increases even at high engine rotations, while higher gears enable faster speeds. Failing to change gears appropriately at different speeds can result in "knocking" (when speed drops below a gear’s range) or "revving" (when the engine runs beyond the gear’s limit without increasing speed).

Key Features
The simulator provides an interface for users to mimic key driving actions with a manual transmission, including:

Increasing Speed: Simulate pressing the gas pedal to increase speed incrementally.
Decreasing Speed: Simulate releasing the gas pedal or braking to decrease speed incrementally.
Changing Gears: Shift up or down by one gear, affecting speed potential and engine behavior.
Status Reporting: Display the vehicle’s current state, indicating if the engine is "knocking" or "revving" based on the speed and gear.
This simulation offers insight into how manual transmission vehicles work, providing a foundation for understanding the algorithmic control involved in speed and gear management in both manual and automatic transmission systems.
